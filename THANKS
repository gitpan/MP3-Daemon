thank you letter I got for MP3::Daemon.

=item Patrik Tschudin <ptschudin@datanetworks.ch>

for telling me about his ROSS project, and giving me an idea about
what direction MP3::Daemon may need to take to help him reach his goal.

=item Sean E. McSherry <mcsherry@mcsherry.org>

for suggesting that I add randomization, and for hinting about some
bad behaviour in the client.  I found the bugs and fixed them.

He's using MP3::Daemon in conjunction with an X10 remote control unit
in his very wired house.

=item Daniel Pearson <dpears2@umbc.edu>

for putting up w/ my freshmeat.net newbie-ness, and for writing
Moosic which is a Python variation on MP3::Daemon.  It was interesting
to compare and contrast the two implementaions.  A little competition
is nice, too ;-)
