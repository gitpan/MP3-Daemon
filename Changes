Revision history for Perl extension MP3::Daemon

+ means it still needs to be done
- means it's done

0.05
    - made MP3::Daemon a base-class for others to subclass.
    - made MP3::Daemon::Simple what MP3::Daemon used to be
    - updated /bin/mp3 to use M:D:S
    - changed ./ex to default to use M:D:Pimp.
      If you want to experiment with M:D:Simple, run it as
      ./ex Simple

    - wrote POD for bin/mp3 and Daemon.pm
    - changed the behaviour of del such that it'll go loop back to the
      beginning if the last track is deleted.
    - fixed a bug where "mp3 play 0" would be interpreted as 
      "mp3 play" which is not the same thing.
    - changed the format of the info that info() and time()
      return to be more human-readable.
    - del can now handle negative indices
    - made pod2usage output to STDOUT.  I didn't realize
      it was going to STDERR.
    - play now knows about negative indices, too

0.03  Sun Jan 28 00:26:48 MST 2001
    - changed the behaviour of play
      only takes 0 or 1 parameter
      if parameter is a non-negative integer, play the track at that index,
      else add it to the end of the playlist and start playing it.
    - changed the behaviour of del
      no parameters deletes the last track from the playlist.
      multiple parameters deletes multiple tracks
    - ls now indicates current track with /^>/
    - added time() which tells you
      time elapsed
      time left
      time total
    - added a bunch of shortcuts in bin/mp3
    - removed debugging noise
    - del() correctly reindexes itself
    - made it so that only certain methods can be invoked
      by clients.
